* mingw32 gem

2010-22-03 John Mair (Banisterfiend)
* automatically convert from array to packed string in Devil.from_blob

2009-6-12 John Mair (Banisterfiend)
* version 0.1.9.1
* added thumbnail2 and resize2 for anti-aliased image scaling
* made Gosu::Window#screenshot 1.9 compatible (now using glReadPixels)
* using version.rb to help manage versions

2009-14-11 John Mair (Banisterfiend)
* added to ruby_il.c:
* IL::SetInteger, IL::JPG_QUALITY
* added to ruby_ilu.c:
* ILU::CompareImage
* added test_quality.rb to tests
* added :jpg_quality option parameter to Devil::Image#save

2009-11-11 John Mair (Banisterfiend)
* version 0.1.9.0 re-release
* REMOVED ILUT (OpenGL) support because ILUT is not built with OpenGL support on all platforms (e.g gentoo and some ubuntu distros)

2009-11-10 John Mair (Banisterfiend)
* version 0.1.9.0
* added ILUT (OpenGL) support
* updated installation info (no longer using c:\windows\system\ for dlls)

2009-10-29 John Mair (Banisterfiend)
* version 0.1.8.8
* added Devil.with_group (for loading multiple images into the same block)
* all images passed into block are cleaned up at end of block
* images at end of block are only free'd if they have not already been freed by user
* ruby_il.c: added IMAGE_BITS_PER_PIXEL and IMAGE_BYTES_PER_PIXEL constants
* finalizers still not implemented

2009-10-28 John Mair (Banisterfiend)
* removed finalizer and replaced with explicit call to image.free at end of block. If no block is used, user must call image.free at end of use
* above fixes memory leak.
* changed STR2CSTR() to StringValuePtr() in ruby_il.c

2009-10-28 John Mair (Banisterfiend)
* added IL::ConvertImage(IL::RGBA, IL::UNSIGNED_BYTE) to Devil#load; ensures that all image data is in the same format (image files only support RGB/UB and RGBA/UB so make them all RGBA/UB)
* changed compile-time conditional for the IL_LBM constant. now checks if IL_LBM is defined before it tries IL_ILBM

2009-10-25 John Mair (Banisterfiend)
version 0.1.8.5
* added hooks: prepare_image_hook, create_image_hook, load_image_hook 
* e.g Devil.set_options :load_image_hook => proc { IL::ConvertImage(IL::RGBA, IL::UNSIGNED_BYTE) }
* added Devil.create_image() method for creating blank images (useful as a blitting canvas?)
* added :color parameter to create_image (to set background color of new image)
* added :in_profile and :out_profile to Devil.load_image and Devil.create_image
* color profiles do not appear to work! so not officially supported or documented.
* fixed gosu image flip bug
* added more tests and rdoc

2009-10-22 John Mair (Banisterfiend)
* added ESC exit from Devil::Image#show
* added optional :filter parameter to Devil::Image#thumbnail and Devil::Image#resize

2009-10-21 John Mair (Banisterfiend)
version 0.1.8
* made LANCZOS3 scaling filter the default for highquality thumbnails
* changed clear color to DevIL default (mother of pearl and full alpha)
* added blit function to HLA (high level API)
* added mirror, edge_detect, emboss, enlarge_canvas, etc to HLA
* added ILU_CENTER, ILU_LOWER_LEFT, ILU_PLACEMENT etc to LLA
* include ILU and IL modules in Devil::Image now
* made Devil::Image#show return self
* made Devil::Image#show use a dup of the image (so a 'snapshot' is taken of image)
* added Devil.set_options method to HLA
* refactored HLA to use an 'action' method, saved code duplication of set_binding/error_check etc.

2009-10-17 John Mair (Banisterfiend)
* ruby_il.c added:
* constants: IMAGE_DEPTH, ORIGIN_SET, CONV_PAL, CUR_IMAGE, ORIGIN_LOWER_LEFT, ORIGIN_LOWER_RIGHT

* Modified FromBlob method to restore old binding after use.
* ruby_ilu.c added:
* methods: EnlargeCanvas, EdgeDetectP, EdgeDetectS, Emboss, Mirror, SwapColours.
* Modified Crop to now take z-axis parameters. (stick to original API as closely as possible)

2009-10-15 John Mair (Banisterfiend)
* hopefully fixed compile errors on SnowLeopard!
* added error checking to Devil::load_image()
* added monkeypatch to Gosu::Image::new() to transparently load multiple formats
